# sudo-touchid
`sudo-touchid` is a fork of `sudo` with Touch ID support (powered by the `LocalAuthentication` framework). Once compiled, it will allow you to authenticate `sudo` commands with Touch ID in the Terminal on supported Macs (such as the late 2016 MacBook Pros).

Since Darwin sources for macOS 10.12 are not available yet, this project is based on `sudo` sources corresponding to OS X 10.11.6 and obtained from [opensource.apple.com](http://opensource.apple.com).
